# Assets Directory

This directory contains all the assets used in the AI Fantasy Battle Arena platform, including images, models, and sound files.

## Structure Overview
```
/assets
│── /images # Images used for the frontend (e.g., icons, backgrounds)

│── /sounds # Sound effects and background music
│── README.md # Documentation for asset usage and management
```

## Key Components
1. **Images Directory:**  
   - Icons, logos, and backgrounds for the game's frontend.  
   - All images should be optimized for web use to reduce loading times.

2. **Models Directory:**  
   - 3D models and animations used for game characters and environments.  
   - Supported formats: `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.gltf`.

3. **Sounds Directory:**  
   - Contains sound effects and background music for enhancing the game experience.  
   - Supported formats: `.mp3`, `.wav`.

## Guidelines for Asset Management
1. Organize assets into subdirectories based on their type (e.g., `/images`, `/models`).  
2. Use clear and descriptive file names (e.g., `battle_icon.png`, `main_theme.mp3`).  
3. Optimize all assets before uploading to minimize performance impact.  

## Contribution Guidelines
- Ensure all assets comply with copyright and licensing requirements.  
- Document the purpose and usage of each asset in this file.  
- Only upload assets that are actively used in the platform.
